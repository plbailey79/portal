The final examination is on Thursday, December 13, 2007, at 3:10 PM in room WIL 227.
This room is a little small, but should fit all of us.
You may use a calculator on the final.
Below is a link to a practice final.  There is no guarantee that this is anything like
the actual final; it was test generated and contains 50 multiple choice problems.
Study this, and Midterm Exam 1, Midterm Exam 2, and Midterm Exam 2a.
