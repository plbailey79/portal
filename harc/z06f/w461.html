The quadratic formula was proven (geometrically) in Euclid's Elements.

The cubic equation was first solved and described 
in the beginning of the sixteenth
century by del Ferro, Tartaglia, and Cardano (with much contention
regarding the discovery's attribution).

The fourth degree was solved by Ferrari, a student of Cardano.

The solution of fifth degree polynomial equations evaded mathematicians,
and it was suspected that such a solution did not exist.
Ruffini gave the first proof of such a result, although it was incomplete.
Abel wrote a successful proof that such a formula, in general, could not
exist.  Galois, without knowing the work of Abel, described explicit conditions
under which solutions can or cannot be written for a given polynomial.
