Good morning!  It's finally test day!  
This will be the last of my daily postings.
We have built, day by day,
nine rows of five days each!  Who
would have thought on March 16 it would eventually look
like this (probably anyone who really thought
about it).

<br><br>

This morning, I will read the work you submitted yesterday,
to give you feedback.  
Please review my solutions to AP's mock exam, which
I posted yesterday.  They may not be perfect but they do compile.

<br><br>

Good luck on your exam.  Have a great summer.
