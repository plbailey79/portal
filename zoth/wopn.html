Open Source Software

This page contains links to some of my favorite open source
programs. Open source software is often better than commercial
software, and is FREE.<BR>

An advanced compression utility is
<A href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</A><BR><BR>

A powerful yet simple text editor is
<A href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</A><BR><BR>

An excellent code comparison application is
<A href="http://winmerge.org/?lang=en">WinMerge</A><BR><BR>

A great command line C compiler is
<A href="https://bellard.org/tcc/">Tiny C Compiler (TCC)</A><BR><BR>

Geogebra allows the user to make geometric constructions and to graph functions.

GAP is a computer algebra system which concentrates on group theory,
but also handles rings, fields, vector spaces, and so forth.  It is
powerful, syntactically elegant, and free (being open source).
Documentation is included.<BR>
Dowload the most recent version of GAP at

TeX is a mathematical type setting language.  The user creates a source
file in any text editor, which is then compiled.  
The basic compiler is separate from the text editor.
We recommend MiKTeX in conjunction with WinEdt. <BR><BR>

First, download and install MiKTeX, obtained from
<A href="http://www.miktex.org/">http://www.miktex.org</A><BR>
Next, download and install WinEdt, obtained from
<A href="http://www.winedt.com/">http://www.winedt.com</A><BR>
Installation of WinEdt should find your version of MikTeX, so
that the WinEdt editor/shell can compile.  The compiler creates
a .DVI file, which is then viewed using YAP (yet another previewer),
printed, or converted to .PDF.<BR>
You may need a book to explain how
to write the "code" which is compiled.<BR>
I learned from 
<A href=https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByyPe1pXMityQkgzMEFrY09uQlU>Math into TeX: a simple introduction to AMS-LATEX</A>.<BR>

AMS-Latex is one of the brands of TeX; it is the one required by
the AMS (American Mathematical Society) for article submission.
MiKTeX is open-source (thus free); WinEdt was written by a math grad
student to help him create his thesis, and he is still improving it.
Send him the $30 he requests.<BR><BR>

There is no reason to buy expensive database management systems
like Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server, because the open source SQL
database known as MySQL is just as good for most things, is faster,
and is FREE.  This is very easy to use; check it out if you have any
inclination to store and/or analyze data.<BR>
